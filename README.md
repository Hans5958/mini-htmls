This repository hosts my collection of projects where I do some random stuff using HTML5, CSS, and JS. There are some things I made that probably don't need another repository for itself, so I put those here for ease of access.

Some of these stuffs are useful for some people, and that might also apply to you, so don't forget to check it out.
