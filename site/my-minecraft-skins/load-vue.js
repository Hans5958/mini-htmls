Because of a common GBC has no arms and legs, I made him a kind of an armor to beat every enemy he gets! While he has not to fight you can use him to play video games which are inserted in the back of his head. Otherwise just give him a sword and put him right under your pillow. He will come out and protect you from evil enemies if you need it!'

The model T3455 got hacked by homeless people and they turn these robots into their slaves.<br />After the research result was published, Gwrinholk Robotic Company decided to shut this project of model T3455 down because they could not control over a lot of their robots which causing wasting money for service and supporting. So they changed the name of model to F3455, the failed model, and gave its codename "Abandonbot".'
